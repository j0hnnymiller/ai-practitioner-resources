## 🎯 Problem Statement

Currently, local development of the AI Practitioner Resources page requires manually opening `index.html` in a browser, which has several limitations:

- **CORS Issues**: Cannot load external resources (like GitHub Gists) due to browser security restrictions
- **No Live Reload**: Developers must manually refresh after changes
- **Limited Testing**: Difficult to test with different data sources locally
- **No Development Tools**: Missing linting, formatting, and build processes
- **Manual Setup**: No automated way to set up the development environment

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Add comprehensive local development support with the following components:

### 1. Development Server

- Add a simple HTTP server for local development (Python, Node.js, or static server)
- Enable CORS handling for external API calls
- Support for live reload on file changes

### 2. Package Management

- Add `package.json` with development dependencies
- Include scripts for common development tasks
- Set up local development server

### 3. Development Tools

- **Linting**: ESLint for JavaScript code quality
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Validation**: JSON schema validation for resource files
- **Testing**: Basic testing framework for validating functionality

### 4. Local Data Support

- Create sample/mock data for offline development
- Allow developers to test with local JSON files
- Provide easy switching between local and remote data sources

### 5. Documentation

- Update README with detailed local development instructions
- Add troubleshooting guide for common development issues
- Include examples of common development workflows

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Suggested File Structure

```
ai-practitioner-resources/
├── package.json                 # Node.js dependencies and scripts
├── .eslintrc.json              # ESLint configuration
├── .prettierrc                 # Prettier configuration
├── dev/
│   ├── server.js               # Local development server
│   ├── sample-data.json        # Sample data for testing
│   └── mock-api.js             # Mock API endpoints
├── scripts/

│   ├── format-code.js          # Code formatting
│   └── build.js                # Build process
└── docs/

```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node dev/server.js",
    "start": "npm run dev",
    "lint": "eslint *.js dev/ scripts/",
    "format": "prettier --write *.html *.js *.json *.md",
    "validate": "node scripts/validate-schema.js",
    "build": "npm run lint && npm run validate",
    "test": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Local development server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Live reload works when files are changed
- [ ] CORS issues are resolved for external API calls
- [ ] Sample data is available for offline development
- [ ] Linting and formatting tools are configured
- [ ] JSON schema validation works locally
- [ ] README includes comprehensive local development instructions
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work
- [ ] No breaking changes to the current deployment process

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: `npm install` to install dependencies
2. **Development**: `npm run dev` to start local server
3. **Testing**: `npm test` to validate changes
4. **Formatting**: `npm run format` to format code
5. **Validation**: `npm run validate` to check JSON schema

## 📚 Additional Considerations

- Ensure the solution works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Keep the setup simple and lightweight
- Maintain compatibility with GitHub Pages deployment
- Consider adding VS Code workspace settings for better developer experience
- Add pre-commit hooks for automatic validation and formatting

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Improved Developer Experience**: Faster development with live reload
- **Better Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting
- **Easier Testing**: Local data and mock APIs for testing
- **Consistent Environment**: Standardized development setup
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Simplified onboarding for contributors

## 📝 Notes

This enhancement will make the project more accessible to developers and improve the overall development workflow while maintaining the current simplicity of deployment.
