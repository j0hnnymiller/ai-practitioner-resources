  "introduction": "<p>AI coding assistants have revolutionized software development, offering unprecedented productivity gains and creative problem-solving capabilities. However, their integration into development workflows introduces <strong>seven principal risks</strong> that can compromise security, quality, and maintainability if not properly managed. These risks span from security vulnerabilities and logic flaws to data leakage, licensing violations, maintainability issues, bias propagation, and over-reliance concerns.</p><p>This collection addresses these challenges through a <em>risk-mitigation focused approach</em>, organizing resources by their ability to help developers safely harness AI assistance while preserving code quality and security standards. Each resource is evaluated on a 1-100 scale across the seven risk dimensions, with selection prioritized by <strong>highest individual risk area scores</strong> to ensure practical applicability over generic guidance.</p><p>The resources provide actionable strategies, proven frameworks, and battle-tested practices that enable teams to maximize AI coding benefits while maintaining professional development standards and mitigating potential risks.</p>",
